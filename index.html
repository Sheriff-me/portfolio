      <div class="about-img">
          <img src="IMG-20250408-WA0001.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Ingredients:

            2 cups whole wheat flour (atta)
            
            ½ teaspoon salt (optional)
            
            ¾ cup warm water (adjust as needed)
            
            1 tablespoon oil or ghee (optional, for softer chapattis)
            
            Extra dry flour (for rolling)   
            
            Step-by-Step Instructions:
            
            1. Make the Dough:
            
            a. Mix dry ingredients:
            
            In a large bowl or flat mixing dish (parat), add 2 cups of whole wheat flour and salt if using.
            
            
            b. Add water gradually:
            
            Slowly pour in warm water while mixing the flour with your hand or spoon.
            
            Add a little water at a time to avoid making the dough too wet.
            
            
            c. Knead:
            
            Use your hands to knead the mixture into a soft, smooth dough. This usually takes 8–10 minutes.
            
            If the dough feels too sticky, add a little flour. If it's too dry, sprinkle more water.
            
            
            d. Rest the dough:
            
            Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 20–30 minutes. This helps the gluten relax and makes the chapattis softer.
            
            2. Divide and Roll:
            
            a. Make dough balls:
            
            Divide the dough into equal-sized balls (golf-ball size is common).
            
            
            b. Dust with dry flour:
            
            Lightly coat a ball with dry flour so it doesn’t stick to the rolling pin.
            
            
            c. Roll it out:
            
            On a flat surface, roll the ball into a thin, round disc about 6–8 inches wide. Try to make it evenly thin throughout.
            
            3. Cook the Chapatti:
            
            a. Preheat the pan:
            
            Heat a tava, cast iron skillet, or non-stick pan on medium-high heat until hot.
            
            
            b. Place the chapatti on the pan:
            
            Carefully place the rolled dough onto the hot pan.
            
            
            c. First side:
            
            Cook for about 30 seconds or until you see bubbles or light spots.
            
            
            d. Flip:
            
            Flip the chapatti and cook the second side for 30–40 seconds. Press gently with a spatula to help it cook evenly.
            
            
            e. Second flip (optional puffing):
            
            Flip again and cook for another 20–30 seconds, pressing gently. The chapatti may puff up — this is a good sign of softness!
            
            
            f. Remove and keep warm:
            
            Remove from pan and place in a covered container or wrap in a clean kitchen towel to keep warm and soft.
            
            Optional (for extra softness/flavor):
            
            Brush chapattis with ghee or butter after cooking.
            
            Serve immediately or store in a covered container to retain softness.
            
            Serving Suggestions:
            
            Serve chapattis hot with:
            
            Lentils (dal)
            
            Vegetable curry
            
            Meat dishes
            
            Yogurt and pickles.</p>
